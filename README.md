# React-Button-Fontawesome
Creating declarative components button in React.JS and using icon from FontAwesome

This code is very flexible because I'm import the FontAwesome only in the index file and each the Button.js dosen't have any import for FontAwesome, its just props the icon from index.stories.

I'm seperate each function of button to see it easily, if you want to combine them just call the function from btn.css

I'm used the code with Storybook.
